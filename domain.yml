  utter_ask_about_yourself:
  - text: He is typically a BCom graduate which was out of interest, unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, he had to take a degree in commerce. he realized that he had to change his domain and build his career in which he was passionate about, he made my mind and shifted to the technical domain. he had to face a lot of challenges during the transition period of his domain. First, he started by joining a course on CCNA (Cisco certified), CEH (Certified Ethical Hacking), and ADMA(Advance Diploma in multimedia Animation). Later he felt he was not stable in a particular technology so he decided to learn Data Science. He felt self-learning won't help to grow his knowledge and stretch his hands on the vast subject, so he moved on to Bangalore with a lot of hurdles on my way in search of his dream and joined an institute and completed a Data Science course, and did internship and projects on Data Science where he was assigned with projects where he had to do it from scratch. He is a passionate learner and grasper. He will never give up on his dreams.
